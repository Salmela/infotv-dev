# Infotv-dev
The project's idea is to implement page where users can see the current news. The main goal of the projects is to write the admin panel. After the course, I may try to copy some of the admin panel code from this project into my old project called InfoTV

### Actions
* Anybody can see the pages
* Contributors and admins can log in to the admin panel
* Contributors can write new pages
* Contributors can remove their own pages
* Admins can add new themes and fonts to the system.
* Admins can add new users to the system.

* [Manual](doc/main.pdf)
