\chapter{Introduction}
The projects goal is to show current news for the visitors. The project consists of main page and admin panel. The main page only shows the current news and the admin panel allows contributors to write new news pages to the main page.

The project allows organization to show relevant news about their current projects to the their employees. The admin panel must allow adding, listing and removing of the fonts, themes and pages.

Most of the development will happen on my local computer, but I will update the progress to the users-server before weeks deadline. I will implement the project in php and the project most likely will integrate the tinymce text editor into the admin panel.

The project won't require javascript and I will try to fallback to simple html forms if the javascript is not present. The web pages will require obviously css and html support from the browser and I try to write the code so that it will at least somehow work in older browsers, but it may not look as pretty.

I will propably first use Mysql database for the project, but I may migrate to the Postgres if there is problems with Mysql. To allow better portability I won't use sql procedures nor some other exotic features.
